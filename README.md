# TCXPowerScaler

Command-line tool for scaling power values in TCX files.

For example, Garmin watches assume by default that all power meter pedals are mounted on 172.5 mm crank arms.  If yours are a different length and you forget to update this before a ride, every value in that ride will be off by the same percentage.  This tool can rescale the values for you to fix this type of issue.
